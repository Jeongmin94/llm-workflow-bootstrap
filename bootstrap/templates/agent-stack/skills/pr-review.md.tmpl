# PR Review Skill Contract (Common)

Shared behavior for model-specific `pr-review` wrappers.

## Goal

Run a repeatable review cycle on `main...HEAD` and produce actionable findings.
This review layer is part of the OpenSpec + beads workflow: findings must be tracked in beads.

## Required Behavior

1. Identify the PR for the current branch (create if missing).
2. Run review on `git diff main...HEAD`.
3. Focus on correctness, regressions, missing tests, and architectural risks.
4. Create or update beads issues for findings.
5. Do not edit source files in review-only mode.

## Finding Format

Each finding should include:

- concise title
- severity (P1/P2/P3)
- description of impact
- exact file + line reference

## Guardrails

- Avoid duplicate issues for the same finding.
- If no findings, report a clean review explicitly.
- Do not merge automatically.
