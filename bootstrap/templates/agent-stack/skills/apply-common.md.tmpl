# Apply Skill Contract (Common)

This is the shared behavior for all model-specific `*-apply` skills.

## Input

- `{{ISSUE_PREFIX}}-xxx` issue ID, OR
- OpenSpec change name, OR
- no argument (select from `bd ready --json`)

## Mandatory Stack Usage

- OpenSpec artifacts (`proposal/design/specs/tasks`) are the source-of-truth for implementation scope.
- beads issue state (`bd update/close/sync --json`) is mandatory for ownership and execution tracking.
- If an issue maps to a change (`[opsx]` convention or explicit change name), load OpenSpec context before editing code.

## Required Behavior

1. Resolve target issue/change.
2. Follow `docs/workflows/apply-common.md` exactly.
3. Claim issue before edits.
4. Keep edits in scope.
5. Run quality gates.
6. Close issue (or leave notes) and push.
7. Run post-apply handoff flow from `.agent-stack/skills/post-apply-checklist.md`.

## Guardrails

- Never work on an issue claimed by another agent.
- Never commit directly to `main`.
- Commit message must include issue ID.
- Stop and report if blocked.
