# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Project-level conventions for AI agents.

## Workflow

- Planning/specs (required): OpenSpec
- Execution tracking (required): beads
- Canonical apply flow: `docs/workflows/apply-common.md`

OpenSpec artifacts are the implementation source-of-truth, and beads issue status is required for session state transitions.

## Coding Conventions

- Keep comments concise and in English.
- Keep edits scoped to the assigned issue.
- Prefer minimal, composable changes over broad rewrites.
- Add tests for behavior changes where feasible.

## Required beads Rules

- All `bd` commands should include `--json`.
- Issue must be claimed before implementation:
  - `bd update <id> --status in_progress --json`
- Close or update notes before ending a session.
- Commit messages must include issue IDs (`{{ISSUE_PREFIX}}-xxx`).

## Multi-Agent Rules

- Use one worktree per agent.
- Branch naming: `agent/<agent-name>/<feature-slug>`.
- Never commit directly to `main`.
